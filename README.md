# python_plotting

An easily customizable collection of graphing/plotting routines in python 3.x to replace OriginPro and GraphPad for the beginning python user.

Scripts are deliberately written to be simple, procedural (no functions), and well-documented so that non-programmers can understand the logic and cut and paste bits of code to get the perfect publication-quality graphs.  

Each script is provided as a jupyter notebook (.ipyn) and old school .py file for those of us who prefer blinking cursors to interactive cells.
